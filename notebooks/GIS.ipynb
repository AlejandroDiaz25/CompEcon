They will prove very useful when doing research, especially to show the spatial distribution of your variables of interest, contructing new measures, or doing spatial analysis."

      "Ok...now that we have a working GIS desktop system, let us talk a little about types of data. All GIS data includes elements with their properties and their geographical information like location, as determined by e.g. latitude and longitude, address, zip code, etc. So, for example an element might be a country, its properties might be GDP per capita, Gini coefficient, etc. and its location. Another example might be a restaurant with its menu and prices, services (dine-in, take-out, delivery), area of service and location. \n",

Where this location $ij$ is, is determined by the actual format and the projection of the data (this will be clearer below). \n",
      "2. Vectors represent a geographical element geometrically and include additional information on it. An element can be represented as one of the following geometries:\n",
      "    1. A point or set of unconnected points\n",
      "    2. A line or set of (un)connected lines\n",
