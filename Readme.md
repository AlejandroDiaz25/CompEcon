This repository contains notebooks I have written to help my students get started using IPython for doing Computational Economics, Economic Growth, and Dynamic Macroeconomics in general. I highly recommend students to also check out [John Stachurski's website](http://johnstachurski.net/personal/edtc.html) and book. 

These lectures are pretty much still work in progress.
