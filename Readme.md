This repository contains notebooks I have written to help my first and second year Ph.D. students get started using Jupyter/IPython for doing Computational Economics, Economic Growth, Comparative Development, and Dynamic Macroeconomics in general. I highly recommend students to also check out [John Stachurski's website](http://johnstachurski.net/personal/edtc.html) and his book. 

These lectures are work in progress (more up-to-date notes may be found in my [Economic Growth and Comparative Development Website](https://econgrowth.github.io)). Comments are welcome.

=======

In order to work with them, you need to:

1. Download the zipped file and extract its contents into a directory (preferably a subdirectory in your home directory). 
2. Use your computer's terminal (OSX's terminal or [iterm2](http://www.iterm2.com/), Windows `cmd`) to go to the `notebooks` subdirectory in the  directory where you extracted the files. E.g. if you extracted into `$HOME/CompEcon` then at the terminal prompt execute `cd ~/CompEcon/notebooks`
3. At the terminal prompt execute `ipython notebook`

Then a webpage should open with the notebooks. Click on the one you want to work with.

It is obviously presupposed you have IPython installed. If that is not the case, then head over to my [Economic Growth and Comparative Development Website](https://econgrowth.github.io) and follow the [instructions](https://econgrowth.github.io/pages/Computation.html).

-> Enjoy! <-
