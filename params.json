I highly recommend students to also check out [John Stachurski's website](http://johnstachurski.net/personal/edtc.html) and book. \r\n\r\nThese lectures are work in progress. Comments are welcome.\r\n\r\n=======\r\n\r\nIn order to work with them, you need to:\r\n\r\n1. Download the zipped file and extract its contents into a directory (preferably a subdirectory in your home directory). \r\n2. Use your computer's terminal (OSX's terminal or [iterm2](http://www.iterm2.com/), Windows `cmd`) to go to the `notebooks` subdirectory in the  directory where you extracted the files. E.g. if you extracted into `$HOME/CompEcon` then at the terminal prompt execute `cd ~/CompEcon/notebooks`\r\n3. At the terminal prompt execute `ipython notebook`\r\n\r\nThen a webpage should open with the notebooks. Click on the one you want to work with.\r\n\r\nIt is obviously presupposed you have IPython installed. If that is not the case, then head over to [Enthought Canopy](https://www.enthought.com/products/canopy/academic/) and install it.\r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n\r\n","google":"UA-48650617-2","note":"Don't delete this file!
